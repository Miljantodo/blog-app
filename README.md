React assignment: Blog project
Descritpion of assignment:

Create a React web application that has 2 pages:
Users Posts

On the Users page, all users should be displayed, and pagination should be implemented. 30 users should be displayed on each page. A card with the following information should be displayed for each user: name and email. Clicking on the card takes you to a special page where you can see more information for that user (name, email, gender and status). Below information, display up to 10 posts belonging to that user. If the user has no posts, print the message "User has no posts".

All posts should be displayed on the Posts page, and pagination should also be implemented. 20 posts should be displayed on each page. For each post, a card with the following information should be displayed: the name of the user whose post it is and the title of the post. Clicking on the card takes you to a separate page where you can see more information for that post (user name, user email, post title, post body). In addition to that data, add the "View comments" button, clicking on which opens a special modal with all comments for the corresponding post. The focus is not so much on appearance, but on functionality. Put some effort into making it look decent, but stay focused on the bottom line: Functionality Reuse components File structure and meaningful names for functions, components, etc. Use of any library is allowed.
BONUS 1: Implement the ability to edit user data. BONUS 2: Implement the possibility to edit the post.
